 * @method string getMultiZoneSubnetPolicy() Obtain Multi-availability zone/subnet policy. Valid values: `PRIORITY` and `EQUALITY`. Default value: `PRIORITY`.
<br><li>`PRIORITY`: When an instance is being created, the availability zone/subnet is chosen from top to bottom in the list. The first availability zone/subnet is always used as long as instances can be created.
<br><li>`EQUALITY`: Instances created for scaling out are distributed to multiple availability zones/subnets, so as to keep the number of instances in different availability zone/subnet in balance.

Notes:
<br><li> When the scaling group is based on the classic network, this policy applies to multiple availability zones. When the scaling group is based on a VPC, this policy applies to multiple subnets, and you do not need to consider availability zones. For example, if you have four subnets (A, B, C, and D) and A, B, and C are in availability zone 1 and D is in availability zone 2, you only need to decide the order of the four subnets, without worrying about the issue of availability zones.
<br><li> This policy is applicable to multiple availability zones/subnets, but is not applicable to multiple models with launch configurations. Specify the models according to the model priority.
<br><li> When `PRIORITY` policy is used, the multi-model policy prevails the multi-availability zones/subnet policy. For example, if you have Model A/B, and Subnet 1/2/3, the model-subnet combinations are tried in the following order: A1 -> A2 -> A3 -> B1 -> B2 -> B3. If A1 is sold out, A2 (not B1) is tried next.
 * @method void setMultiZoneSubnetPolicy(string $MultiZoneSubnetPolicy) Set Multi-availability zone/subnet policy. Valid values: `PRIORITY` and `EQUALITY`. Default value: `PRIORITY`.

<br><li>`LAUNCH_CONFIGURATION`: the launch configuration mode.
<br><li>`SPOT_MIXED`: a mixed instance mode. Currently, this mode is supported only when the launch configuration takes the pay-as-you-go billing mode. With this mode, the scaling group can provision a combination of pay-as-you-go instances and spot instances to meet the configured capacity.

 * @method boolean getCapacityRebalance() Obtain Indicates whether the capacity rebalancing feature is enabled. This parameter is only valid for spot instances in the scaling group. Valid values:
<br><li>`TRUE`: yes. Before the spot instances in the scaling group are about to be automatically repossessed, AS will terminate them. The scale-in hook (if configured) will take effect before the termination. After the termination process starts, AS will asynchronously initiate a scaling activity to meet the desired capacity.
<br><li>`FALSE`: no. In this case, AS will add instances to meet the desired capacity only after the spot instances are terminated.
