 * AttachDisks request structure.

 * @method array getDiskIds() Obtain ID of the elastic cloud disk to be mounted, which can be queried through the API [DescribeDisks](/document/product/362/16315). A maximum of 10 elastic cloud disks can be mounted in a single request.
 * @method void setDiskIds(array $DiskIds) Set ID of the elastic cloud disk to be mounted, which can be queried through the API [DescribeDisks](/document/product/362/16315). A maximum of 10 elastic cloud disks can be mounted in a single request.
 * @method string getInstanceId() Obtain ID of the CVM instance on which the cloud disk will be mounted. It can be queried via the API [DescribeInstances](/document/product/213/15728).
 * @method void setInstanceId(string $InstanceId) Set ID of the CVM instance on which the cloud disk will be mounted. It can be queried via the API [DescribeInstances](/document/product/213/15728).
 * @method boolean getDeleteWithInstance() Obtain Optional parameter. If this is not passed only the mount operation is executed. If `True` is passed, the cloud disk will be configured to be terminated when the server it is mounted to is terminated. This is only valid for pay-as-you-go cloud disks.
 * @method void setDeleteWithInstance(boolean $DeleteWithInstance) Set Optional parameter. If this is not passed only the mount operation is executed.
