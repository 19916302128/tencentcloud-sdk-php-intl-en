/**
 * @method Models\CreateScdnFailedLogTaskResponse CreateScdnFailedLogTask(Models\CreateScdnFailedLogTaskRequest $req) This API is used to recreate a failed event log task.
 * @method Models\PurgePathCacheResponse PurgePathCache(Models\PurgePathCacheRequest $req) This API is used to submit multiple directory purge tasks, which are carried out according to the acceleration region of the domain names.
By default, a maximum of 100 directories can be purged per day for acceleration regions either within or outside the Chinese mainland, and up to 500 tasks can be submitted at a time.
 * @method Models\PushUrlsCacheResponse PushUrlsCache(Models\PushUrlsCacheRequest $req) This API is used to cache specified URL resources to CDN nodes. You can specify acceleration regions for the prefetch.
By default, a maximum of 1000 URLs can be prefetched per day for regions either within or outside the Chinese mainland, and up to 500 tasks can be submitted at a time. Note that resources prefetched outside the Chinese mainland will be cached to CDN nodes outside the Chinese mainland and the traffic generated will incur costs.
