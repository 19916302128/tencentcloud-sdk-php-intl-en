 * @method string getStartTime() Obtain Query start time, such as 2018-09-04 10:40:00; the returned result is later than or equal to the specified time.
According to the specified time granularity, forward rounding is applied; for example, if the query end time is 2018-09-04 10:40:00 and the query time granularity is 1 hour, the time for the first returned entry will be 2018-09-04 10:00:00.
The gap between the start time and end time should be less than or equal to 90 days.
 * @method void setStartTime(string $StartTime) Set Query start time, such as 2018-09-04 10:40:00; the returned result is later than or equal to the specified time.
According to the specified time granularity, forward rounding is applied; for example, if the query end time is 2018-09-04 10:40:00 and the query time granularity is 1 hour, the time for the first returned entry will be 2018-09-04 10:00:00.
The gap between the start time and end time should be less than or equal to 90 days.
 * @method string getEndTime() Obtain Query end time, such as 2018-09-04 10:40:00; the returned result is earlier than or equal to the specified time.
According to the specified time granularity, forward rounding is applied; for example, if the query start time is 2018-09-04 10:40:00 and the query time granularity is 1 hour, the time for the last returned entry will be 2018-09-04 10:00:00.
The gap between the start time and end time should be less than or equal to 90 days.
 * @method void setEndTime(string $EndTime) Set Query end time, such as 2018-09-04 10:40:00; the returned result is earlier than or equal to the specified time.
According to the specified time granularity, forward rounding is applied; for example, if the query start time is 2018-09-04 10:40:00 and the query time granularity is 1 hour, the time for the last returned entry will be 2018-09-04 10:00:00.

If the domain name is not specified, the specified project will be queried. Up to 30 acceleration domain names can be queried at a time
If the domain name information is specified, the domain name will prevail
 * @method string getInterval() Obtain Time granularity; valid values:
`min`: data with 1-minute granularity is returned when the queried period is no longer than 24 hours. This value is not supported if the service region you want to query is outside Mainland China;
`5min`: data with 5-minute granularity is returned when the queried period is no longer than 31 days;
`hour`: data with 1-hour granularity is returned when the queried period is no longer than 31 days;
