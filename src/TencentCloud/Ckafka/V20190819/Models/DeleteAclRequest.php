 * DeleteAcl request structure.
 *
 * @method string getInstanceId() Obtain Instance ID information
 * @method void setInstanceId(string $InstanceId) Set Instance ID information
 * @method integer getResourceType() Obtain ACL resource type. 0: UNKNOWN, 1: ANY, 2: TOPIC, 3: GROUP, 4: CLUSTER, 5: TRANSACTIONAL_ID. Currently, only `TOPIC` is available, and other fields will be used for future ACLs compatible with open-source Kafka
 * @method void setResourceType(integer $ResourceType) Set ACL resource type. 0: UNKNOWN, 1: ANY, 2: TOPIC, 3: GROUP, 4: CLUSTER, 5: TRANSACTIONAL_ID. Currently, only `TOPIC` is available, and other fields will be used for future ACLs compatible with open-source Kafka
 * @method string getResourceName() Obtain Resource name, which is related to `resourceType`. For example, if `resourceType` is `TOPIC`, this field indicates the topic name; if `resourceType` is `GROUP`, this field indicates the group name
 * @method void setResourceName(string $ResourceName) Set Resource name, which is related to `resourceType`. For example, if `resourceType` is `TOPIC`, this field indicates the topic name; if `resourceType` is `GROUP`, this field indicates the group name
 * @method integer getOperation() Obtain ACL operation mode. 0: UNKNOWN, 1: ANY, 2: ALL, 3: READ, 4: WRITE, 5: CREATE, 6: DELETE, 7: ALTER, 8: DESCRIBE, 9: CLUSTER_ACTION, 10: DESCRIBE_CONFIGS, 11: ALTER_CONFIGS, 12: IDEMPOTEN_WRITE. Currently, CKafka only supports `READ` and `WRITE`, and other values will be used for future ACLs compatible with open-source Kafka
 * @method void setOperation(integer $Operation) Set ACL operation mode. 0: UNKNOWN, 1: ANY, 2: ALL, 3: READ, 4: WRITE, 5: CREATE, 6: DELETE, 7: ALTER, 8: DESCRIBE, 9: CLUSTER_ACTION, 10: DESCRIBE_CONFIGS, 11: ALTER_CONFIGS, 12: IDEMPOTEN_WRITE. Currently, CKafka only supports `READ` and `WRITE`, and other values will be used for future ACLs compatible with open-source Kafka
 * @method integer getPermissionType() Obtain Permission type. 0: UNKNOWN, 1: ANY, 2: DENY, 3: ALLOW. Currently, CKafka supports `ALLOW` (equivalent to allowlist), and other fields will be used for future ACLs compatible with open-source Kafka
 * @method void setPermissionType(integer $PermissionType) Set Permission type. 0: UNKNOWN, 1: ANY, 2: DENY, 3: ALLOW. Currently, CKafka supports `ALLOW` (equivalent to allowlist), and other fields will be used for future ACLs compatible with open-source Kafka
 * @method string getHost() Obtain The default value is `*`, which means that any host can access. Currently, CKafka does not support the host as `*`, but the future product based on the open-source Kafka will directly support this
 * @method void setHost(string $Host) Set The default value is `*`, which means that any host can access. Currently, CKafka does not support the host as `*`, but the future product based on the open-source Kafka will directly support this
 * @method string getPrincipal() Obtain User list. The default value is `*`, which means that any user can access. The current user can only be one included in the user list
 * @method void setPrincipal(string $Principal) Set User list. The default value is `*`, which means that any user can access. The current user can only be one included in the user list
