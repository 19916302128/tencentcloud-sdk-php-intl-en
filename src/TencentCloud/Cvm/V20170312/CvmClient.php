* It does not support `STOPPED` CVMs.
* A VNC URL is only valid for 15 sec. If you do not access the URL within 15 seconds, it will become invalid and you will have to query another one.
* Once you access a VNC URL, it will become invalid and you will have to query another one.
* If the connection breaks up, you can make up to 30 requests per minute to reestablish the connection.

* The system disk will be formatted and reset. Therefore, make sure that no important files are stored on the system disk.
* If the operating system switches between `Linux` and `Windows`, the system disk `ID` of the instance will change, and the snapshots that are associated with the system disk can no longer be used to roll back and restore data.
* If no password is specified, you will get a random password via internal message.
* You can only use this API to switch the operating system between `Linux` and `Windows` for instances whose [system disk type](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/9452#SystemDisk) is `CLOUD_BASIC`, `CLOUD_PREMIUM`, or `CLOUD_SSD`.
* Currently, this API only supports instances in Mainland China regions.
* @method Models\ResetInstancesInternetMaxBandwidthResponse ResetInstancesInternetMaxBandwidth(Models\ResetInstancesInternetMaxBandwidthRequest $req) This API is used to change the public bandwidth cap of an instance.

* The allowed bandwidth cap varies for different models. For details, see [Purchasing Network Bandwidth](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/509).
* For bandwidth billed by the `TRAFFIC_POSTPAID_BY_HOUR` method, changing the bandwidth cap through this API takes effect in real time. Users can increase or reduce bandwidth within applicable limits.

* Currently, you cannot use this API to change the models of [CDH](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/416) instances.
* @method Models\ResizeInstanceDisksResponse ResizeInstanceDisks(Models\ResizeInstanceDisksRequest $req) This API (ResizeInstanceDisks) is used to expand the data disks of an instance.

* Currently, you can only use the API to expand non-elastic data disks whose [disk type](/document/api/213/9452#block_device) is `CLOUD_BASIC`, `CLOUD_PREMIUM`, or `CLOUD_SSD`. You can use [`DescribeDisks`](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/api/362/16315) to check whether a disk is elastic. If the `Portable` field in the response is `false`, it means that the disk is non-elastic.
* Currently, this API does not support [CDH](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/416) instances.
* Currently, only one data disk can be expanded at a time.
* @method Models\RunInstancesResponse RunInstances(Models\RunInstancesRequest $req) This API is used to create one or more instances with a specified configuration.

* After an instance is created successfully, it will start up automatically, and the [instance state](/document/api/213/9452#instance_state) will become "Running".
* If you create a pay-as-you-go instance billed on an hourly basis, an amount equivalent to the hourly rate will be frozen before the creation. Make sure your account balance is sufficient before calling this API.
* The number of instances you can purchase through this API is subject to the [CVM instance purchase limit](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2664). Both the instances created through this API and the console will be counted toward the quota.
* This API is an async API. An instance `ID` list will be returned after you successfully make a creation request. However, it does not mean the creation has been completed. The state of the instance will be `Creating` during the creation. You can use [DescribeInstances](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/15728) to query the status of the instance. If the status changes from `Creating` to `Running`, it means that the instance has been created successfully.
* @method Models\StartInstancesResponse StartInstances(Models\StartInstancesRequest $req) This API is used to start instances.

* You can only perform this operation on instances whose status is `STOPPED`.

* Batch operations are supported. The maximum number of instances in each request is 100.
* @method Models\StopInstancesResponse StopInstances(Models\StopInstancesRequest $req) This API is used to shut down instances.

* You can only perform this operation on instances whose status is `RUNNING`.
* The instance status will become `STOPPING` when the API is called successfully and `STOPPED` when the instance is successfully shut down.
* Forced shutdown is supported. A forced shutdown is similar to switching off the power of a physical computer. It may cause data loss or file system corruption. Be sure to only force shut down a CVM when it cannot be sht down normally.
* Batch operations are supported. The maximum number of instances in each request is 100.
* @method Models\SyncImagesResponse SyncImages(Models\SyncImagesRequest $req) This API is used to sync a custom image to other regions.

* Each API call syncs a single image.
* This API supports syncing an image to multiple regions.
* Each account can have up to 10 custom images in each region. 
* @method Models\TerminateInstancesResponse TerminateInstances(Models\TerminateInstancesRequest $req) This API is used to return instances.
