/**
 * CompareFaceLiveness response structure.
 *
 * @method string getResult() Obtain Service error code. When the return value is "Success", it indicates that the liveness detection and face comparison succeeded. It is determined that they are the same person. When the return value is "FailedOperation.CompareLowSimilarity", it indicates that the liveness detection succeeded, and the face comparison similarity is lower than 70 points. It is determined that they are not the same person. For other error cases, please refer to Liveness Face Comparison (Pure API) Error Code (https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1061/55390). 
Example Value: "Success".
 * @method void setResult(string $Result) Set Service error code. When the return value is "Success", it indicates that the liveness detection and face comparison succeeded. It is determined that they are the same person. When the return value is "FailedOperation.CompareLowSimilarity", it indicates that the liveness detection succeeded, and the face comparison similarity is lower than 70 points. It is determined that they are not the same person. For other error cases, please refer to Liveness Face Comparison (Pure API) Error Code (https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1061/55390). 
Example Value: "Success".
 * @method string getDescription() Obtain Description of business results. 
Example value: "Success"
 * @method void setDescription(string $Description) Set Description of business results. 
Example value: "Success"
 * @method float getSim() Obtain This value is valid when the “Result” parameter is "Success" or "FailedOperation.CompareLowSimilarity." 
This value indicates the similarity of face comparison. Value range: [0.00, 100.00]. The false pass rate for threshold 70 is 1 in 1,000, and the false pass rate for threshold 80 is 1 in 1,000. 
Example value: 80.00
 * @method void setSim(float $Sim) Set This value is valid when the “Result” parameter is "Success" or "FailedOperation.CompareLowSimilarity." 
This value indicates the similarity of face comparison. Value range: [0.00, 100.00]. The false pass rate for threshold 70 is 1 in 1,000, and the false pass rate for threshold 80 is 1 in 1,000. 
Example value: 80.00
 * @method string getBestFrameBase64() Obtain The optimal screenshot of the video after verification is the value encoded by BASE64, jpg format. 
Note: This field may return “null”, indicating that no valid value can be obtained. 
Example values: "/9j/4AAQSk... (total length:142036)s97n//2Q=="
 * @method void setBestFrameBase64(string $BestFrameBase64) Set The optimal screenshot of the video after verification is the value encoded by BASE64, jpg format. 
Note: This field may return “null”, indicating that no valid value can be obtained. 
Example values: "/9j/4AAQSk... (total length:142036)s97n//2Q=="
 * @method string getRequestId() Obtain The unique request ID, which is returned for each request. RequestId is required for locating a problem.
 * @method void setRequestId(string $RequestId) Set The unique request ID, which is returned for each request. RequestId is required for locating a problem.
