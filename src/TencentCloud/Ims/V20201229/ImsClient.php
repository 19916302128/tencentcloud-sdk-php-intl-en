/**
 * @method Models\ImageModerationResponse ImageModeration(Models\ImageModerationRequest $req) This API is used to submit an image for smart moderation. Before using it, you need to log in to the console with the Tencent Cloud root account [to activate IMS](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cms/image/package) and adjust the business configuration.
### API use instructions
- Go to the "[CMS console - IMS](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cms/image/package)" to activate IMS.
- This API is a paid API. For its billing mode, see [IMS Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/product/ims/pricing?from_cn_redirect=1).

### API feature description
- It can detect images or links and recognize content that may be offensive, unsafe, or inappropriate based on the deep learning technology;
- It can capture frames from or split GIF/long images for detection;
- It can recognize various non-compliant scenarios, including vulgarity, law or regulation violations, pornography, and advertising;
- It can detect multiple types of objects (such as object, advertising logo, and QR code) and recognize text in images based on OCR;
- It allows you to customize moderation policies based on different business scenarios;
- You can select image risk libraries to filter non-compliant images of custom types (currently, only blocklist configuration is supported);
- You can associate account or device information when moderating an image to recognize the account or device involved.

### API call description
- Supported image file size: **< 5 MB**
- Supported image file resolution: **a resolution of 256x256 or higher** is recommended; otherwise, the recognition effect may be affected.
- Supported image file formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP, GIF, and WEBP.
- Supported image URL transfer protocols: HTTP and HTTPS.
- If you pass in the access URL of an image, you need to **limit the image download time to 3 seconds**. To ensure the stability and reliability of the image to be detected, we recommend you use Tencent Cloud COS for storage or CDN for caching.
- Default API request rate limit: **100 requests/sec**. If this limit is exceeded, an error will be reported.
