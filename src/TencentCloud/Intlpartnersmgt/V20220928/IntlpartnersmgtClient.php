/**
 * @method Models\AllocateCustomerCreditResponse AllocateCustomerCredit(Models\AllocateCustomerCreditRequest $req) This API is used for a partner to set credit for a customer, such as increasing or lowering the credit and setting it to 0.
1. The credit is valid permanently and will not be zeroed regularly.
2. The customer's service will be suspended when its available credit is set to 0, so caution should be exercised with this operation.
3. To prevent the customer from making new purchases without affecting their use of previously purchased products, the partner can set their available credit to 0 after obtaining the non-stop feature privilege from the channel manager.
4. The set credit is an increment of the current available credit and cannot exceed the remaining allocable credit. Setting the credit to a negative value indicates that it will be repossessed. The available credit can be set to 0 at the minimum.
