<li>black: fill with black. This option retains the aspect ratio of the source video for the screenshot and fills the unmatched area with black color blocks.</li>
<li>white: fill with white. This option retains the aspect ratio of the source video for the screenshot and fills the unmatched area with white color blocks.</li>

 * @method integer getVcrf() Obtain The control factor of video constant bitrate. Value range: [1, 51]
If this parameter is specified, CRF (a bitrate control method) will be used for transcoding. (Video bitrate will no longer take effect.)
It is not recommended to specify this parameter if there are no special requirements.
 * @method void setVcrf(integer $Vcrf) Set The control factor of video constant bitrate. Value range: [1, 51]
