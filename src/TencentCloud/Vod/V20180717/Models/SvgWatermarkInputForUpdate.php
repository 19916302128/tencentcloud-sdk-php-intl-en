/**
 * Input parameter of SVG watermarking template
 *
 * @method string getWidth() Obtain Watermark width, which supports six formats of px, %, W%, H%, S%, and L%:
<li>If the string ends in px, the `Width` of the watermark will be in px; for example, `100px` means that `Width` is 100 px; if `0px` is entered
 and `Height` is not `0px`, the watermark width will be proportionally scaled based on the source SVG image; if `0px` is entered for both `Width` and `Height`, the watermark width will be the width of the source SVG image;</li>
<li>If the string ends in `W%`, the `Width` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the video width; for example, `10W%` means that `Width` is 10% of the video width;</li>
<li>If the string ends in `H%`, the `Width` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the video height; for example, `10H%` means that `Width` is 10% of the video height;</li>
<li>If the string ends in `S%`, the `Width` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the short side of the video; for example, `10S%` means that `Width` is 10% of the short side of the video;</li>
<li>If the string ends in `L%`, the `Width` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the long side of the video; for example, `10L%` means that `Width` is 10% of the long side of the video;</li>
<li>If the string ends in %, the meaning is the same as `W%`.</li>
Default value: 10W%.
 * @method void setWidth(string $Width) Set Watermark width, which supports six formats of px, %, W%, H%, S%, and L%:
<li>If the string ends in px, the `Width` of the watermark will be in px; for example, `100px` means that `Width` is 100 px; if `0px` is entered
 and `Height` is not `0px`, the watermark width will be proportionally scaled based on the source SVG image; if `0px` is entered for both `Width` and `Height`, the watermark width will be the width of the source SVG image;</li>
<li>If the string ends in `W%`, the `Width` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the video width; for example, `10W%` means that `Width` is 10% of the video width;</li>
<li>If the string ends in `H%`, the `Width` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the video height; for example, `10H%` means that `Width` is 10% of the video height;</li>
<li>If the string ends in `S%`, the `Width` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the short side of the video; for example, `10S%` means that `Width` is 10% of the short side of the video;</li>
<li>If the string ends in `L%`, the `Width` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the long side of the video; for example, `10L%` means that `Width` is 10% of the long side of the video;</li>
<li>If the string ends in %, the meaning is the same as `W%`.</li>
Default value: 10W%.
 * @method string getHeight() Obtain Watermark height, which supports six formats of px, %, W%, H%, S%, and L%:
<li>If the string ends in px, the `Height` of the watermark will be in px; for example, `100px` means that `Height` is 100 px; if `0px` is entered
 and `Width` is not `0px`, the watermark height will be proportionally scaled based on the source SVG image; if `0px` is entered for both `Width` and `Height`, the watermark height will be the height of the source SVG image;</li>
<li>If the string ends in `W%`, the `Height` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the video width; for example, `10W%` means that `Height` is 10% of the video width;</li>
<li>If the string ends in `H%`, the `Height` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the video height; for example, `10H%` means that `Height` is 10% of the video height;</li>
<li>If the string ends in `S%`, the `Height` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the short side of the video; for example, `10S%` means that `Height` is 10% of the short side of the video;</li>
<li>If the string ends in `L%`, the `Height` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the long side of the video; for example, `10L%` means that `Height` is 10% of the long side of the video;</li>
<li>If the string ends in %, the meaning is the same as `H%`.
Default value: 0 px.
 * @method void setHeight(string $Height) Set Watermark height, which supports six formats of px, %, W%, H%, S%, and L%:
<li>If the string ends in px, the `Height` of the watermark will be in px; for example, `100px` means that `Height` is 100 px; if `0px` is entered
 and `Width` is not `0px`, the watermark height will be proportionally scaled based on the source SVG image; if `0px` is entered for both `Width` and `Height`, the watermark height will be the height of the source SVG image;</li>
<li>If the string ends in `W%`, the `Height` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the video width; for example, `10W%` means that `Height` is 10% of the video width;</li>
<li>If the string ends in `H%`, the `Height` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the video height; for example, `10H%` means that `Height` is 10% of the video height;</li>
<li>If the string ends in `S%`, the `Height` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the short side of the video; for example, `10S%` means that `Height` is 10% of the short side of the video;</li>
<li>If the string ends in `L%`, the `Height` of the watermark will be the specified percentage of the long side of the video; for example, `10L%` means that `Height` is 10% of the long side of the video;</li>
<li>If the string ends in %, the meaning is the same as `H%`.
Default value: 0 px.
 * @method WatermarkCycleConfigForUpdate getCycleConfig() Obtain Watermark cycle configuration, which is used to configure watermarks so that they will be displayed and hidden periodically.
Primary use case: watermarks can be added at various positions in a video, which are displayed and hidden periodically to prevent them from being covered.
For example, watermarks A, B, C, and D are set in the top-left corner, top-right corner, bottom-right corner, and bottom-left corner of a video, respectively. After the first video frame, { A will be displayed for 5s -> B for 5s -> C for 5s -> D for 5s } -> A for 5s -> B for 5s -> ... Only one watermark will be visible at any time.
Within the braces ({}) is a major cycle composed of four watermarks, namely, A, B, C, and D, which lasts for 20 seconds in a cycle.
Watermarks A, B, C, and D are displayed periodically for 5 seconds and hidden for 15 seconds each in a fixed order.
This configuration item is used to describe the cycle configuration of a single watermark.
